## About This Folder:
This folder contains functions & classes that are quite useful (hence the folders name). They will then be
seperated into different folders, one for each subject. Unless, there are zero files in that subject, in this
case there won't be a folder for that subject. Also if there is function and or class in the other useful-stuff, which by the way is located in phaser-examples. It will not be included in this usefulStuff.
